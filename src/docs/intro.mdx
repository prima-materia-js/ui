# About

Prima Materia UI is a basic component library for React. Use the links on the left to browse the different categories of components.

# Features

Prima Materia UI is designed to quickly create a usable UI for a web application built on React. It provides components for page layout, navigation, forms and user input, and styling.

## Themes

Light and dark mode are supported. You can customise each theme's color schemes using the `<ThemeConfiguration>` component. Refer to the **Theming** section on the left to read more.

Use the `<ThemeToggle>` component anywhere in your app to toggle between light and dark mode.

## Navigation

Some components used for navigation, such as `<NavLink>` are designed to be used with the `react-router-dom` package only. You may not be able to use these if you are using a
different routing library.

# How to Use

## Installation

```
$ npm install @prima-materia/ui
```

or

```
$ yarn add @prima-materia/ui
```

## Using the library in your app

In your app's entry point (e.g. `index.tsx`), first load the common stylesheet:

```
import '@prima-materia/ui/dist/style.css';
```

Then, wrap your app in the `<ThemeConfiguration>` component:

```
root.render(
  <ThemeConfiguration>
    <App />
  </ThemeConfiguration>
);
```

You can now import and use any component in your app.
